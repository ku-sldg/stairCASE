# CakeML Examples
Various CakeML example put together while learning the language.

To use the examples:

1. Run make in the cake-x64 directory to build the cake compiler executable.

2. Change the variables 'CAKE_LOCATION' and 'BASIS_LOCATION' in cakewrap.py to
    point at the locations of the cake executable and 'basis_ffi.c' files. Use
	absolute pathnames.

3. Now running make in apdt or wordcount should build the executables.
